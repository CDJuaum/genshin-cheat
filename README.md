So, after a lot of time learning how to make cheats I came up with the idea of making a cheat for genshin impact. It actuallt worked pretty well and I wanted to share it with you guys just cuz.
as you can see in the picture, you can set your own keybinds so that it is more practical for anyone.
cheat features:
god mode;
stamina;
no cooldown for habilities;
free flight, which I find pretty cool;
NoClip;
double attacks;
rapid fire;
auto-kill;
chest ESP;
health ESP;
level ESP;
block enemies;
and more.
